Here is a potential matrix war game scenario on election cyber security:

**Election Cyber Security War Game Scenario**
=============================================

### Background
----------------

In the not-too-distant future, the United States has experienced a series of high-profile elections where cyber attacks have compromised voting systems. In response to these incidents, a new federal agency, the Election Cyber Security Directorate (ECSD), has been established to coordinate and enhance election security across the country.

The ECSD is responsible for overseeing the implementation of new cybersecurity measures in all 50 states, as well as providing resources and support to state and local election officials. However, with limited budget and personnel, the agency faces significant challenges in its mission to secure the integrity of the electoral process.

### Objectives
----------------

The objective of this war game scenario is for players to assume the roles of key stakeholders involved in the ECSD's efforts to enhance election cyber security across the country. Players will be tasked with navigating complex decision-making processes, competing interests, and limited resources to achieve their objectives.

**Players' Objectives:**

* As the Director of the ECSD, your objective is to successfully implement a new federal cybersecurity standard for all 50 states within a set timeframe.
* As a State Election Official, your objective is to ensure that your state meets the new federal cybersecurity standard while minimizing costs and disruptions to your existing systems.
* As a Cybersecurity Expert, your objective is to provide technical guidance and support to both the Director of the ECSD and State Election Officials.

### Starting Situation
--------------------

The scenario begins on January 1st, with the following key factors in place:

* The federal agency responsible for overseeing election cyber security (ECSD) has just been established.
* A new cybersecurity standard has been drafted by the ECSD, but it requires approval from Congress and state legislatures before implementation.
* All 50 states have varying levels of existing cybersecurity measures in place, ranging from basic to advanced.
* The budget allocated to the ECSD for implementing a national cybersecurity standard is limited.

### Players
------------

**Director of the ECSD:**

* Character Description: Experienced government official with expertise in election security and management.
* Strengths: Strong leadership skills, excellent communication abilities.
* Weaknesses: Limited technical knowledge, may struggle with complex cybersecurity decisions.

**State Election Official:**

* Character Description: Seasoned election administrator with experience managing local elections.
* Strengths: Deep understanding of state-specific laws and regulations, able to navigate complex decision-making processes.
* Weaknesses: May be limited in technical expertise, could face resistance from stakeholders within their own state.

**Cybersecurity Expert:**

* Character Description: Experienced cybersecurity professional with expertise in election security and vulnerability assessment.
* Strengths: Strong technical knowledge, ability to provide expert guidance on cybersecurity measures.
* Weaknesses: May struggle with non-technical aspects of the scenario, could be seen as too focused on the technical side.

### Potential Actions
----------------------

**Director of the ECSD:**

* Approve or reject state-by-state implementation of the new federal cybersecurity standard based on their meeting of specific security criteria.
* Allocate limited resources (budget, personnel) to support states in implementing the new standard.
* Negotiate with Congress and state legislatures for approval of the national cybersecurity standard.

**State Election Official:**

* Decide whether to implement the new federal cybersecurity standard, or opt-out due to cost, resource, or regulatory concerns.
* Negotiate with the Director of the ECSD for additional resources (budget, personnel) to support implementation of the new standard.
* Develop and implement state-specific cybersecurity measures in place of, or in addition to, the federal standard.

**Cybersecurity Expert:**

* Provide technical guidance on implementing the new federal cybersecurity standard across all 50 states.
* Assess the effectiveness of existing cybersecurity measures in each state.
* Develop and propose additional cybersecurity measures for consideration by both the Director of the ECSD and State Election Officials.
1. "Redteam creates a fake news article implicating several local election officials in various corrupt activities, manipulating the content to appear on popular news websites that are frequently visited by the American public." This move is likely to succeed because of the widespread trust in online media and the lack of vigilance among internet users regarding the authenticity of news articles.

2. "Redteam uses advanced social engineering tactics to disseminate the fake news article through a network of bots, trolls, and compromised accounts on various social media platforms." This move is likely to succeed due to the vast reach of social media networks and the susceptibility of users to believe information shared by their peers or perceived authority figures.

1. "Redteam disguises themselves as a cybersecurity firm offering a free security audit for the Democratic Party, gaining access to their network infrastructure. This is likely to succeed because, despite previous breaches, the party may view this offer as an opportunity to improve their security measures."

2. "Redteam creates and disseminates leaked emails among various political groups and social media platforms, hinting at the existence of incriminating evidence against local election officials. This is likely to succeed because it will sow distrust among the public about the integrity of the election process, aligning with our goal."
