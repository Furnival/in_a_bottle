**Election Cyber Security Matrix Wargame Scenario**
=====================================================

### **Background**

In the fictional country of "Cygnus", a presidential election is set to take place on November 3rd. The incumbent president, James Wilson, is seeking re-election against his challenger, Alexandra Rodriguez. As the election approaches, concerns about cyber security threats have grown.

The Cygnus government has created an Interagency Cyber Security Task Force (ICSTF) to coordinate efforts and provide guidance to state and local authorities on protecting their electoral systems from cyber threats. However, despite these efforts, there are indications that malicious actors may still attempt to disrupt the election process through cyber means.

### **Objectives**

The objective of this matrix wargame scenario is to explore how the ICSTF can effectively respond to a range of cyber security threats during the presidential election in Cygnus. The game will focus on the following objectives:

*   Identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the electoral system
*   Develop effective strategies for mitigating and responding to cyber attacks
*   Assess the impact of different scenarios on the election process and outcomes

### **Starting Situation**

**Time:** October 20th, two weeks before the election

**Status:**

*   The ICSTF has been established, but there is limited coordination among state and local authorities.
*   There are indications that Russian-based cyber actors may be planning to disrupt the election process through phishing attacks on voters and social engineering tactics targeting poll workers.

**Cyber Threat Level:** Moderate (based on intelligence reports)

### **Players**

1.  **ICSTF Director**: The leader of the ICSTF, responsible for coordinating efforts among state and local authorities.
2.  **Federal Agency Representatives**: Representatives from various federal agencies involved in election security, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
3.  **State and Local Officials**: Representatives from state and local governments responsible for conducting the presidential election.
4.  **Cyber Threat Actors**: Representing Russian-based cyber actors planning to disrupt the election process.

### **Potential Actions**

1.  **ICSTF Director**:
    *   Coordinating efforts among federal agencies and state/local officials
    *   Developing incident response plans for potential cyber attacks
2.  **Federal Agency Representatives**:
    *   Providing intelligence on potential threats from Russian-based cyber actors
    *   Offering technical assistance to state and local authorities
3.  **State and Local Officials**:
    *   Implementing security measures to protect electoral systems
    *   Reporting incidents or suspicious activity to the ICSTF
4.  **Cyber Threat Actors**:
    *   Planning and executing phishing attacks on voters
    *   Conducting social engineering tactics against poll workers
 Next Move: "Redteam creates a sophisticated forgery of an email conversation between the top Democratic leadership and local election officials, discussing secret deals in exchange for vote manipulation. This email is then planted in the compromised chairman's email account."

   Reason for Success: 1) The timing of the forgery's release could coincide with a crucial election period, maximizing its impact on public perception. 2) The content of the forgery is plausibly deniable, making it difficult for Blueteam to definitively prove its authenticity or lack thereof, thereby sowing doubt in the integrity of the election process.
