*Solo wargame in pluto notebook experiments*  

Solo wargames are interesting for practical reasons and no other reason really. I taught a class for Masters students in cyber security: wargaming was difficult as the distance learning students were prone to last minute, Sunday night blitz working. I.e they were asynchronous, 1x a week. Single move wargames are not effective.

Solo wargames with A.I. participation (Claude, Llama, OpenAI) might have some practical use. I am running in a code notebook for ease of tracking, logging results and reproducibility. Intent is also to have a summary generated by the A.I. of the game. One possible summary format is interactive fiction but with summaries of some branches so the maze like character of a interactive fiction version is avoided. The commentary could be interesting and have some charm.

- Perhaps summary in Inkle Ink generated directly by an fine tuned local Llama?
- Windrift would be better but generation too complicated.
