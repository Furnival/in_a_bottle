Here is a matrix wargame scenario about election cyber security:

**Election Cyber Security Wargame Scenario**
=============================================

### Background
------------

In the wake of increasing concerns over election integrity, the government has decided to hold a national exercise to test the preparedness of state and local officials in protecting their electoral systems from cyber threats. The exercise will simulate a fictional presidential election scenario where a foreign adversary is attempting to interfere with the outcome.

### Objectives
------------

* **Government**: To identify vulnerabilities in the electoral system and assess the effectiveness of current security measures.
* **State and Local Officials**: To demonstrate their ability to respond to a cyber attack on their electoral systems and protect the integrity of the election process.
* **Foreign Adversary**: To test the resilience of the electoral system against sophisticated cyber attacks.

### Starting Situation
--------------------

The scenario begins with:

* A fictional presidential election scheduled for November 3rd, 20XX
* State and local officials have reported various vulnerabilities in their electoral systems, including outdated software, unpatched systems, and inadequate security protocols.
* Intelligence suggests that a foreign adversary (designated as "Russia") has been actively probing the electoral system for weaknesses.

### Players
----------

1. **Government**:
	* Represented by a lead official who will oversee the exercise and provide guidance to state and local officials.
	* Will have access to various resources, including cybersecurity experts, intelligence analysts, and technical support.
2. **State and Local Officials**:
	* Represented by officials from 5-7 states, each with their own electoral systems and security protocols.
	* Will be responsible for protecting their respective electoral systems and responding to any cyber threats.
3. **Foreign Adversary (Russia)**:
	* Will attempt to interfere with the election process through various means, including phishing, malware attacks, and network breaches.

### Potential Actions
-------------------

* **Government**:
	+ Conduct vulnerability assessments on state and local electoral systems.
	+ Provide guidance and resources to support state and local officials in addressing vulnerabilities.
	+ Coordinate with intelligence agencies to monitor for signs of Russian activity.
* **State and Local Officials**:
	+ Report vulnerabilities in their electoral systems and request assistance from the government.
	+ Implement security protocols to protect against cyber threats.
	+ Respond to any successful attacks by Russia and work to mitigate damage.
* **Foreign Adversary (Russia)**:
	+ Conduct reconnaissance on state and local electoral systems to identify vulnerabilities.
	+ Launch targeted attacks on electoral systems to disrupt or manipulate the election process.

Note: This scenario is a simplified example of an election cyber security matrix wargame. The actual game would involve more detailed rules, scenarios, and player interactions.
1. Redteam disguises themselves as a cybersecurity firm offering a complimentary security audit for Blueteam's network infrastructure. The audit request will contain malware that grants them access to key systems upon acceptance. This is likely to succeed because Blueteam is not alert and may trust the offer due to its subtle nature, thinking it is a legitimate security measure.

2. Redteam creates and disseminates fake documents implicating local election officials in financial misconduct, anonymously leaking them to media outlets known for their sensationalism. This is likely to succeed because the American public is often swayed by such scandals, causing doubt in the election's integrity without directly changing the results.1.

 Next Move: "The redteam disguises the trojan as a harmless software update for the voting systems used in several key battleground states, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the systems."

   Reason for Success: 1) Voting system providers may neglect regular security updates or rely on third-party vendors, making them vulnerable to such disguised attacks. 2) The lack of transparency and standardization in voting systems across various states could lead to different levels of vigilance and preparedness, creating an uneven defense landscape that the redteam can exploit.
