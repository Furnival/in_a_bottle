**Matrix Wargame Scenario: Election Cyber Security**
==============================================

### Background
-----------------------------------

In the year 2024, the United States is on the cusp of a highly contested presidential election. As concerns about cyber security grow, both major parties have established dedicated teams to protect their electoral systems from potential threats.

Two rival factions, the **Blue Team** and the **Red Team**, each composed of skilled cybersecurity professionals and politicians, will engage in a high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse. The goal is to outmaneuver one another while ensuring the integrity of the electoral process.

### Objectives
-----------------

*   **Blue Team:** Protect the electoral system from cyber attacks, ensure the accuracy and security of voting results, and maintain public confidence in the democratic process.
*   **Red Team:** Disrupt the electoral system through targeted cyber attacks, compromise sensitive information, and create chaos that undermines public trust in the democratic process.

### Starting Situation
----------------------

The game begins with a heightened sense of tension and uncertainty. Rumors have been circulating about potential cyber threats, but concrete evidence is scarce.

*   **Electoral Systems:** The voting infrastructure is a complex network of interconnected systems, including voter registration databases, polling stations, and vote-counting machines.
*   **Threats:** Both teams are aware of various cyber threats, including phishing attacks, malware infections, and social engineering tactics.

### Players
------------

#### Blue Team:

*   **Team Leader:** A seasoned cybersecurity expert with experience in electoral security.
*   **Voter Registration Specialist:** An IT professional responsible for maintaining voter registration databases.
*   **Polling Station Coordinator:** A local official overseeing polling stations and voting equipment.

#### Red Team:

*   **Team Leader:** A charismatic politician with ties to various cybercrime groups.
*   **Malware Developer:** A skilled hacker who has created sophisticated malware targeting electoral systems.
*   **Disinformation Specialist:** A propagandist who uses social media and other channels to spread false information and create confusion.

### Potential Actions
----------------------

The following actions can be taken by both teams:

#### Blue Team:

*   **Vulnerability Assessment:** Conduct a thorough analysis of the electoral system to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Patch Management:** Implement patches and updates for voting equipment and software.
*   **Cyber Drill:** Conduct regular cyber drills to test the readiness of electoral personnel.

#### Red Team:

*   **Phishing Attack:** Launch a phishing campaign targeting voter registration databases or polling station staff.
*   **Malware Infection:** Infect voting equipment with malware designed to manipulate vote counts.
*   **Social Engineering:** Use social media and other channels to spread false information about the election process.

1. "Redteam conducts a spear-phishing attack on a third-party vendor handling sensitive election data, posing as a trusted source to gain access to their systems." This move is likely to succeed because many vendors may not prioritize cybersecurity training and awareness as much as they should, given the vast amount of responsibilities they handle.

2. "Redteam exploits vulnerabilities in election-related software used by multiple counties, planting malware that alters the audit logs, making it appear as though votes were manipulated." This move is likely to succeed because election officials often rely on outdated software and may not consistently update their systems, leaving them vulnerable to attacks.
